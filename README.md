I was annoyed at how a few of my hosted movie nights ended up being a "choose a movie that suits everybodies mood and taste for an hour and then watch a very much mediocre comedy for the next 2 hours." I would much rather give them my select few to choose from. This way we all get to see what we want, as only people interested will attend the event.

Also this was a good chance to get to know Meteor.js.
